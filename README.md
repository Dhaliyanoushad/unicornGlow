### Project Description

[GlowSync is a wellness-focused web app designed to support women in tracking their menstrual cycle, receiving personalized recipe suggestions based on their mood, and engaging with an AI chatbot for guidance. By integrating health tracking, nutrition, and AI-powered interactions, the app promotes a holistic approach to self-care and well-being.]

### The Problem statement

[Many individuals struggle with managing their menstrual health, finding mood-appropriate nutrition, and accessing personalized wellness support in one place. Existing solutions often lack integration, requiring users to switch between multiple apps for tracking cycles, finding suitable recipes, and seeking guidance. This fragmentation can lead to inconvenience, lack of engagement, and missed opportunities for better self-care.

UnicornGlow aims to address this gap by providing an all-in-one platform that seamlessly combines menstrual tracking, AI-powered mood-based recipe suggestions, and an intelligent chatbot for personalized wellness support.]
